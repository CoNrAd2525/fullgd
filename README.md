# Unified AI Agent Platform

A powerful, enterprise-grade platform that unifies the capabilities of AgentFlow AI and SwarmOS into a single cohesive system for building, deploying, and managing AI agents at scale.

## Overview

This platform combines the workflow orchestration capabilities of AgentFlow with the multi-agent collaboration and infrastructure optimization of SwarmOS to create a comprehensive solution for AI agent development and deployment.

## Key Features

### Agent Development
- Visual canvas for designing agent workflows
- Support for hierarchical, sequential, and parallel agent architectures
- Built-in templates for common agent patterns
- Code-based agent development with Python and TypeScript SDKs

### Memory and Knowledge Management
- Long-term and short-term memory systems
- Vector database integration for knowledge retrieval
- Semantic search capabilities
- Document processing and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### Tool Integration
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless tool integration
- 200+ pre-built connectors for popular services and APIs
- Custom tool development framework
- Secure tool execution environment
- Webhook integration for event-driven workflows
- Pipedream integration for no-code automation

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Role-based agent systems (supervisors, workers, specialists)
- Collaborative problem-solving frameworks
- Human-in-the-loop capabilities

### Infrastructure Optimization
- Self-setting and self-optimizing resource allocation
- Support for on-premise and cloud deployments
- Horizontal scaling for high-demand workloads
- Cost optimization for AI training and inference

### Security and Compliance
- Enterprise-grade security features
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Data privacy controls

### Observability
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Token usage tracking
- Performance analytics
- Execution tracing

## Getting Started

Follow the installation and setup instructions to get started with the platform.

## Webhook Integration

The platform supports webhook integration for event-driven workflows. You can create webhooks to receive notifications when specific events occur in the system, such as workflow completion, agent execution, and more.

### Creating Webhooks

1. Navigate to the Webhooks section in the dashboard
2. Click "Create Webhook"
3. Provide a name, target URL, and select the events you want to subscribe to
4. Save the webhook

### Webhook Events

The following events are supported:

- `workflow.completed`: Triggered when a workflow execution completes successfully
- `workflow.failed`: Triggered when a workflow execution fails
- `workflow.stopped`: Triggered when a workflow execution is stopped manually
- `agent.completed`: Triggered when an agent execution completes successfully
- `agent.failed`: Triggered when an agent execution fails
- `agent.stopped`: Triggered when an agent execution is stopped manually

### Webhook Payload

Webhook payloads include the following information:

```json
{
  "id": "webhook-event-id",
  "event": "event.name",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T12:30:45Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

## Pipedream Integration

The platform integrates with [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) to enable no-code automation workflows.

### Setting Up Pipedream Integration

1. Create a webhook in the Unified AI Agent Platform
2. Create a new workflow in Pipedream
3. Use the HTTP / Webhook trigger in Pipedream
4. Copy the Pipedream webhook URL to your platform webhook
5. Configure actions in Pipedream to process the webhook data

### Example Use Cases

- Trigger Slack notifications when workflows complete
- Update project management tools when agents complete tasks
- Log events to analytics platforms
- Trigger follow-up workflows based on agent results
- Connect to thousands of apps through Pipedream's integrations
